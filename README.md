AI Enabled Android App for Detecting Skin Cancer, by Dr. Yuvraj Kumar (Ph.D - Artificial Intelligence)

Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer.  The main types of skin cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Melanoma is much less common than the other types but much more likely to invade nearby tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Most deaths from skin cancer are caused by melanoma.

In recent days, skin cancer is seen as one of the most Hazardous form of Cancers found in Humans. Skin cancer is found in various types such as Melanoma, Basal and Squamous cell Carcinoma among which Melanoma is the most unpredictable. The detection of Melanoma cancer in the early stage can be helpful to cure it. Computer vision can play important role in Medical Image Diagnosis and it has been proved by many existing systems.

# About Project

The project is mainly divided into two parts:

> TensorFlow and Keras are used to build and create a machine learning model.
> TFLite is used to deploy the model to an Android application.

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), algorithm development and model training has been done to distinguish between benign and malignant skin cancers. 

## Loading the dataset

You can use your own custom dataset. I have used the skin cancer dataset for binary classification of benign vs malignant cancer types, once done, annotation (labelling) needs to be performed. 

# Files

Download all the files in a folder. Install Winrar and unzip the files to view master folder.

# AI Model

Model is already trained using CNN. The model and the ipynb code is in Training folder.

# Android App

I am not an Android Developer. The app could be buggy or may not work at all. If you want to work on this app, you may import the project, look at the code to understand it better, and further look at the AI integration on how it is done.

# Samples used for Model Training

Benign - 30 Images

Malignant - 27 Images
